# Facial Recognition with  Age Robustness

Now a days Facial Recogition systems have great accuracies on different datasets, with precisions near 90%. Specifically on the Facial Recognition task, high precision is very important because of the type of solutions that can be solved using this type of models. This solutions may: be access to private facilites using just the face, phone unlocking and recognition of people in grocerie stores. 

The use of Age difference makes the recognition of faces much more difficult for the model. So if a model is robust in detecting faces with age difference, the features it uses for the prediction must be much better than the ones other type of models use, because this features endure time.
